# Welcom to the SA2py (Solvent-Accessible Surface Area in Python) documentation

SA2py is a python program to calculate the Solvent-Accessible Surface Area (SASA) of a protein.   
The result is the area in square Angstroms for each atom and for the protein.   
This program is devide in three scripts python :   
- main.py, to run the program   
- sasa.py, with all functions to compute the SASA   
- sasa_stat.py, with all functions to build statisticals graphs or pymol files   

The implementation is based on the method presented in the article :
