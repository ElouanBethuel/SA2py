# Welcom to the SA2py documenation 

SA2py is a python program to calculate the Solvent-Accessible Surface Area (SASA) of a protein.   
The result is the area in square Angstroms for each atom and for the protein.   
This program is devide in three scripts python :   
- main.py, to run the program
- sasa.py, with all functions to compute the SASA
- sasa_stat.py, with all functions to build statisticals graphs or pymol files


The methode use to compute the SASA is based about this article :
"Environment and Exposure to Solvent of Protein Atoms. Lysozyme and Insulin" by A.Shrake and J A Rupley
